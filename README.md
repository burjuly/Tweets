# Tweets
Intro to Natural Language Processing. Sentiment Analysis

# Goals

You will try to preprocess text data and train different classifiers trying to solve a classification task with the best possible score.

# Mandatory part
## a. Task
In this project, you will work on sentiment analysis of tweets. You will need to predict whether a tweet is positive, negative, or neutral.


+ Data preparation. Transform tweets into vectors using different approaches.
+ Similarity. Find the top-10 most similar pair of tweets using datasets with different
preprocessing.
+ Machine learning. Using different machine learning algorithms and different datasets with different preprocessing conduct sentiment analysis.

## b. Dataset
• You will work with the dataset of tweets. The tweets are labeled as positive, negative, and neutral. That is it. The source of the dataset.

## c. Implementation
+ You can work in Jupyter Notebooks. The notebooks should be well-formatted. You need to make a split on the train and test (20%) datasets with stratification.
+ You can use the NLTK library or any other that you may find useful for you.
+ You can enrich the dataset by any other dataset that you may find useful or collect
your own.

### Data preparation
You need to try different approaches:
...

You may also try using stop-words to remove the words that create noise and not a signal.


### Similarity
Use different datasets that you prepared in the task above and cosine similarity to find the top- 10 similar pairs of tweets.

### Machine learning
Try different algorithms and different datasets that you prepared before to solve the classification task – sentiment analysis.

## d. Submission
You need to achieve accuracy at least equal 0.832 on the test dataset.
